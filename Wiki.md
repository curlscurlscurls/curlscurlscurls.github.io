# r/curlyhair’s Ultimate Guide to the Curly Girl/Guy Method
## Introduction
We created this document as a more flexible, beautiful, and usable alternative to Reddit’s wiki system. It works better on mobile, we can actually embed images, and we can link directly to different sections! We hope you enjoy it as much as we’ve enjoyed making it.

Please don’t be intimidated by the length! If you’re just getting started, all you need is on a couple pages here. All this information was collected over several years of moderating the active and helpful /r/curlyhair community. Some of the info here has citations (as much as possible) but a lot of it is crowd-sourced information from the community members!

This guidebook is meant to be a reference, something you sit down to answer a specific question (“if I want to go swimming, do I need to do anything special to protect my hair?”) not something you sit down and read through all in one sitting.

It is also a work in progress, so if you see something you’d like to contribute please feel free to message the moderators!

## Getting Started
### What is the CG method?
The Curly Girl/Guy Method (aka CG or CGM) is a gentle, moisturizing hair care method to bring out the best in your curls or waves.

This is a detailed overview of each step of the CG method. Read through it to learn more about how to take care of curly or wavy hair.

**If you just want a straightforward, quick, & cheap starter routine, check out the Beginner Routine!**

### Overview of the basics
Curly hair is almost always super dry by default, thanks to sulfates, the harsh detergents in shampoo. So we remove sulfates from the routine. The problem is that sulfates are used to wash away certain ingredients like silicones, so we remove those too. This leaves only ingredients that can be washed away with JUST water.

The CG method mostly focuses around removing both sulfates and silicones in an attempt to be gentler on already unruly hair!

We’ll go through this in more detail below, but here’s the gist:

1. **Wash** (conditioner-only wash (cowash) or low poo (low lather/sulfate-free shampoo))
2. **Condition** (use lots of conditioner, detangle)
3. **Apply** products (scrunch in a palm full of gel, mousse, or cream)
4. **Dry** (plop, then air dry or diffuse)

**Make sure your products are CG-safe if you co-wash or use low poo!** The fastest way to check ingredients is to google them, then paste them into one of these helpful apps: [Curlsbot](http://www.curlsbot.com/), [IsItCG.](http://www.isitcg.com/)

### Before starting CG: Reset Wash

Before starting CG, **you must wash all the old silicones and product build-up out of your hair with a shampoo that has sulfates but no silicones.**

A great cheap option is [V05 Clarifying Shampoo](https://imgur.com/a/r6Oz24L), available from any drugstore, Target, etc. ([CVS](https://www.cvs.com/shop/vo5-herbal-escapes-shampoo-12-5-oz-prodid-1030385?skuId=130343), [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Alberto-VO5-Herbal-Escapes-Clarifying-Shampoo-Kiwi-Lime-Squeeze-12-5-Oz/34576449). This product works because it has sulfates and no silicones. (It is not CG approved, but that's what we want for this first wash). Shampoo one time with this reset wash shampoo, and then set it aside for now.  (See this short list of suggested products for what to look for if you can't find V05).

**Yes: you will stop regularly using sulfate shampoo after this.**

Just to be absolutely clear: You will use the reset wash shampoo very infrequently (once when starting CG, and again every few weeks or months if needed). Then you will use a different, gentler product to wash your hair. This reset wash shampoo is only used to strip the water-insoluble ingredients out of your hair and will leave it dry if used continually because it contains sulfates. Using it once every couple of weeks is ok to help with buildup, but do not use it as a regular shampoo.

* **Do not skip this step!** This is the most common mistake we see starting out!
* It might take more than one CG-approved wash and some trial & error to see a difference! Give it at least two weeks before posting a follow-up, unless you are desperate.
* After the reset wash, you have now officially started CG!

## Beginner Routine
Be prepared to throw everything you know about haircare out the window! The CG method really shakes things up. Even if it sounds crazy, give it a try!

### Why try the beginner routine?
It’s a quick, ultra minimal, and super cheap way to get started with the CG method! (Total cost: $11.79, as of June 2018.)

This tried-and-true set of products and steps will help you build a foundation that you can modify as you get to know your hair. It will not work for everyone, but it is a great way to get started.

Try it for a month and then come back with more specific questions.

### Steps
![Beginner Routine](/images/beginner_routine.png)

#### RESET WASH
This is the most important step! Do not skip this!

Shampoo your hair with the reset wash shampoo. This will remove all of your old products (and any silicones, wax, etc. that they contain). The first time you do this routine, skip step 1 (Co-wash), since you just washed your hair with shampoo. Every other time, start with co-washing.

Do not use this product every time you wash your hair (once every few weeks to months is okay). Your hair could be very dry and frizzy if you use it too much.

1. CO-WASH
  CO-wash stands for “Conditioner-Only washing.” Yes, that means you will only use conditioner to wash your hair, the conditioner takes the place of shampoo!

  Vigorously massage the conditioner into your scalp and hair, like you would shampoo. While you rinse, keep rubbing to remove oils and dirt. Be sure to rinse thoroughly.
  Not everyone can co-wash, particularly wavies. If this doesn’t work for you, try a sulfate-free shampoo aka low-poo (see the alternative product suggestions below).

  A Note about Cowashing: Lots of people get nervous about putting conditioner on their roots.
  
  * Don't be! Most people adjust within a few weeks. Your scalp will stop overproducing oils if you stop stripping all the oils off with sulfates.
  
  * You can always do a wash with the reset shampoo once every week if need be, especially during the transition period.
  
  * You can also try a low-poo instead if you're very concerned. Check out the very very short go-to list of products for low-poo options.

2. CONDITION AND DETANGLE
  
  Use a ton of conditioner! You’ll want at least a handful for shoulder-length hair, more if it's long or thick. (This is why we recommend inexpensive conditioners.) 
  
  Wait-- I put in MORE conditioner? Didn’t I just co-wash, and isn’t that the same thing? Not quite! It is the same product, but used with different applications/techniques to give different effects. The main focus of co-washing is to get dirt and oils out of your hair, not to make it look nice. Cowashing focuses on the scalp and involves thorough scrubbing and rinsing. Conditioning focuses on the lengths of your hair, letting the conditioner soak in to moisturize and clump the curls. Also, if you want to leave any conditioner in (lots of curlies do!), you can't do that if you only co-wash, since it's critical to completely wash out the co-wash.
  
  Detangle gently with fingers or a wide tooth comb. While your hair is slippery with conditioner in the shower, you can use a wide-toothed comb, a tangle teezer, or a "wet brush" to help remove tangles. Don't brush or comb your hair when dry (it makes curly hair poofy):
  
  OK to use (only while wet):
